# Continued Fork of SkBee
Why did I fork SkBee? Well you see, Shane has said he would stop working on SkBee for reasons, read his statement [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skbee-skript-addon.75839/). I have decided to continue this fork of SkBee as it is a useful plugin. Please note I will **NOT** add anymore features, I am just simply updating it to support latest versions of Minecraft & Skript.
# SkBee-Continued

**SkBee-Continued** is a Skript Addon which is a continued fork of [**SkBee**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee) that aims to add more useful elements to [**Skript**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript).

# State of SkBee 
Shane has made the github public again, but archived the repository. He is no longer continuing SkBee. This fork simply just updates SkBee. If you want a fork that will be updated with new features and such, go to Fusezion's [SkImagine](https://github.com/Fusezion/SkImagine) addon here for more information.

## Elements
This is only a small list of the many things included
- **NBT elements** get/set NBT of items, blocks (tile entities) and entities. (Available for 1.8.8+)
- **ScoreBoards** super-duper simple anti-flicker scoreboards (Available on 1.13+)
- **Recipes** add custom recipes and remove vanilla recipes (Available on 1.13+)
- **BlockData** get/set block data with ease (Available on 1.13+)
- **Structures** use vanilla Minecraft's structure system for saving/pasting structures in your world
- **Particles** a particle system that is a little more advanced than Skript's, that is more inline with Bukkit's particle system
- **TextComponents** a system a little more advanced than Skript's text formatting. You can build text components and manipulate each one separately with things like hover events (including showing an item), click events, and much more.
- **WorldCreator** create your own custom worlds with some handly little options
- **Bounds** create your own simple bounds similarly to WorldGuard regions
- **GameEvents** use Minecraft's GameEvent system, which was created for Skulk Sensors. This system adds more events to the server than were previously available
